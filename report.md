In this lab I learned how to create and manage a new GitHub repository. 
I thereafter practiced how to create files, how to committ changes and I learnt about version history. 
I further learned about semantic HTML and how it improves structure and readability.
This lab has thus helped me understand how Git supports collaborative and structured development.
